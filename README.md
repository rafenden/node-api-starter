# Simple API Starter for Node.js using Express

## Installation on OSX

Make sure you have `node` and `yarn` available at your local computer, I suggest using Homebrew to install them:

```sh
brew install node
brew install yarn
```

To install the project run the following command in the project root:

```sh
yarn
```

## Local development

To start project locally run:

```sh
yarn dev
```
